It is predicated on the foundation that data never exists in a “raw,” unfiltered form and is never a neutral representation of reality. Every time data is created, it already is interpreted in some way - including through choices about <strong>what</strong> to collect, <strong>how</strong> to collect it, how to <strong>organize</strong> it, and how to <strong>store</strong> it. By the time data is being used for analysis, it has already been “cooked” in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.</p> </body></html>
