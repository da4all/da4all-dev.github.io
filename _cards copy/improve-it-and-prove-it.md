First, write a paragraph that explains the rhetorical situation:
- How does your redesigned visualization address a data advocacy need (or exigence)? How does it relate to issues of power, ethics, or justice?
- Who are the intended audiences? (In other words, who needs to hear this story, and who is in a position to do something about it?)
- What effect do you want the redesigned visualization to have on those audiences?
 
Then, write a point-by-point comparison of the two visualizations, explaining what each does well and poorly (and hopefully why yours outperforms the original). Write 3-4 sentences for each of the following aspects:
- the story in the data
- appropriateness of graphic elements
- decoration vs design
- appropriateness of comparisons
- use or misuse of common visual conventions
- appropriateness of frame of reference
